# Open Reading Frame Finder
Reads a DNA sequence from a file, removes header lines, and constructs both the sequence and its reverse complement. It then translates the DNA into protein sequences across all six possible reading frames (three forward, three reverse), identifying the start codons (Methionine 'M') and stop codons ('_') for each frame, and prints their positions.
